# Open Deep Research

An AI-powered research assistant that performs iterative, deep research on any topic by combining search engines, web scraping, and large language models.

The goal of this repo is to provide the simplest implementation of a deep research agent - e.g. an agent that can refine its research direction over time and deep dive into a topic. Goal is to keep the repo size at <500 LoC so it is easy to understand and build on top of.

## Features

- **Iterative Research**: Performs deep research by iteratively generating search queries, processing results, and diving deeper based on findings
- **Intelligent Query Generation**: Uses LLMs to generate targeted search queries based on research goals and previous findings
- **Depth & Breadth Control**: Configurable parameters to control how wide (breadth) and deep (depth) the research goes
- **Smart Follow-up**: Generates follow-up questions to better understand research needs
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Produces detailed markdown reports with findings and sources
- **Persistent Reports**: Completed reports are saved to disk and can be downloaded via `/api/reports/{id}`
- **Concurrent Processing**: Handles multiple searches and result processing in parallel for efficiency

## Requirements

- Node.js environment
- API keys for:
  - Firecrawl API (for web search and content extraction)
  - OpenAI API (for o3 mini model)

## Setup

### Node.js

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables in a `.env.local` file:

```bash
FIRECRAWL_KEY="your_firecrawl_key"
# If you want to use your self-hosted Firecrawl, add the following below:
# FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3002"

OPENAI_KEY="your_openai_key"
ACCESS_KEY="choose_a_strong_key"
# Optional: control how many learnings are processed per report section
# REPORT_CHUNK_SIZE="20"
```

To use local LLM, comment out `OPENAI_KEY` and instead uncomment `OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and `OPENAI_MODEL`:

- Set `OPENAI_ENDPOINT` to the address of your local server (eg."http://localhost:1234/v1")
- Set `OPENAI_MODEL` to the name of the model loaded in your local server.

### Docker

1. Clone the repository
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set your API keys

3. Run `docker build -f Dockerfile`

4. Run the Docker image:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5. Execute `npm run docker` in the docker service:

```bash
docker exec -it deep-research npm run docker
```

## Usage

### API Server (Default)

Start the API server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on port 3051. See the [Web API](#web-api) section below for endpoints.

### CLI Mode

For interactive command-line research:

```bash
npm run cli
```

You'll be prompted to:

1. Enter your research query
2. Specify research breadth (recommended: 3-10, default: 4)
3. Specify research depth (recommended: 1-5, default: 2)
4. Answer follow-up questions to refine the research direction

The assistant asks clarifying questions before starting the actual research. Once you provide your answers, it begins gathering data and compiling the report.

The system will then:

1. Generate and execute search queries
2. Process and analyze search results
3. Recursively explore deeper based on findings
4. Generate a comprehensive markdown report

The final report will be saved as `report.md` or `answer.md` in your working directory, depending on which modes you selected.

### Concurrency

If you have a paid version of Firecrawl or a local version, feel free to increase the `ConcurrencyLimit` by setting the `CONCURRENCY_LIMIT` environment variable so it runs faster.

If you have a free version, you may sometimes run into rate limit errors, you can reduce the limit to 1 (but it will run a lot slower).

### DeepSeek R1

Deep research performs great on R1! We use [Fireworks](http://fireworks.ai) as the main provider for the R1 model. To use R1, simply set a Fireworks API key:

```bash
FIREWORKS_KEY="api_key"
```

The system will automatically switch over to use R1 instead of `o3-mini` when the key is detected.

### Custom endpoints and models

There are 2 other optional env vars that lets you tweak the endpoint (for other OpenAI compatible APIs like OpenRouter or Gemini) as well as the model string.

```bash
OPENAI_ENDPOINT="custom_endpoint"
CUSTOM_MODEL="custom_model"
```

### Web API

The API server starts automatically with `npm start` on port `3051` (or the value of the `PORT` environment variable).

All requests must include an `Authorization` header containing the value of your
`ACCESS_KEY`.

#### Start a report job

Send a `POST` request to `/api/jobs` with the research query and optional `breadth` and `depth`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3051/api/jobs \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"Quantum computing trends","breadth":3,"depth":2}'
```

The response contains a `jobId` and a list of follow-up questions that must be answered before the research begins.

Submit your answers to `/api/jobs/{jobId}/answers`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3051/api/jobs/<jobId>/answers \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"answers":["first answer","second answer"]}'
```

Once the answers are submitted, the job status changes to `pending` and the system starts researching.

#### Poll for results

Fetch `/api/jobs/{jobId}` until the status changes to `completed`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3051/api/jobs/<jobId>
```

When finished, the response will include a `reportUrl` field. Fetch this URL to
download the saved Markdown report:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3051/api/reports/<jobId> > report.md
```

## How It Works

1. **Initial Setup**

   - Takes user query and research parameters (breadth & depth)
   - Generates follow-up questions to understand research needs better

2. **Deep Research Process**

   - Generates multiple SERP queries based on research goals
   - Processes search results to extract key learnings
   - Generates follow-up research directions

3. **Recursive Exploration**

   - If depth > 0, takes new research directions and continues exploration
   - Each iteration builds on previous learnings
   - Maintains context of research goals and findings

4. **Report Generation**
   - Compiles all findings into a comprehensive markdown report
   - Includes all sources and references
   - Organizes information in a clear, readable format
